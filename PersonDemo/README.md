## Introduction

Moving on from the usual assignments, today I'm tasked with learning how classes and objects work + the fundamentals of what even OOP is. This assignment is about a Person class with its own attributes like name and age + methods such as a greeting.

## Environment Setup

- JDK (Java Development Kit) Version 23.0.2 
- Visual Studio Code as my IDE (Integrated Development Environment) because my laptop is a potato and can't handle any other ones.
- Git as a way to push files to Github

## Challenges

There really wasn't any challenges other than the process of learning how the structure works and what each syntax is and does. The code was already given by my lecturer as a foundation and all I did was study and added some extra attributes.
